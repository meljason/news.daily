# news.daily
The news daily is a web app I created to provide daily news and to give updates of the number of cases of COVID-19

## API Used
- Google Login API (console.developers.google.com)
- News API (newsapi.org)
- Covid-19 API (https://github.com/mathdroid/covid-19-api)

## Redirect URLs
For the google login api, I used the redirect url of http://localhost/FinalProjectAPI-MelJasonChongWoYuen/index.php tested in Localhost.
